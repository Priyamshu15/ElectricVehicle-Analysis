# ElectricVehicle-Analysis
📊 A simple Python project analyzing Electric Vehicle data in Jupyter Notebook. Includes data exploration, summary stats, and visual insights using the same dataset as used in the Excel dashboard version.
# 🔋 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Python (Jupyter)

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Electric Vehicle (EV) population trends using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used here is the same as in the related Excel dashboard project, allowing a consistent, tool-agnostic look at EV data.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following fields:

- `County`
- `City`
- `Model Year`
- `Make` 
- `Model` 
- `Electric Vehicle Type`
- `Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility`
- `Electric Range`
- `Base MSRP`  

The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to EV adoption, vehicle types, performance ranges, pricing trends, and eligibility for clean fuel programs.

## 💻 What’s Inside

- `Python_PMGSY_Road_Project_Dashboard.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for EV data analysis
- `Python_dataset.csv`: Dataset file
- `/screenshots/`: Screenshots of code outputs and analysis


## 📊 Key Features

- Filtering and exploration of EV types and models  
- Summary statistics for electric range and base MSRP  
- Year-wise trends and model distribution  
- Analysis of CAFV eligibility  
- Clean code structure with comments and screenshots

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- (Optional: Pandas for extended operations)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `EV_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to see analysis results
